# NOverlay #

An extension for Google Chrome to prevent overlays (often called modal windows) from being added to the webpage

# Why? #

Modal windows have become the new pop-up window. Just as pop-up windows were abused by developers in the late '90s to sell advertising, so too are modal windows being abused to bug users into signing up for accounts, signing up for newsletters, or drawing attention to something else the user probably doesn't care about.

NOverlay intends to be the pop-up blocker of modal windows.
